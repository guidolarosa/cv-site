  'When I graduated from high-school in 2010 I had a deep interest in sound and music, so I studied one year of Sound Design.',
  'After that I got accepted in ENERC, which is the National Cinema School. I learned a lot about the industry and Sound Design for Cinema, which was my specialization, but found out that I was not very interested in this kind of career.',
  'Around that time I discovered code. A friend introduced me to Frontend Development and I started an intense self-learning path diving deep into web technologies. I learned about the basics (HTML, CSS, JS) and then I started working on some real world projects, which taught me a lot in a short period of time.',
  'Meanwhile I learned a lot of stuff related to computer graphics, illustration, animation, design and design tools. I also worked briefly doing Motion Graphics and making illustrations (you can see them following my links).',
