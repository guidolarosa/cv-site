  'After finishing school I had a deep interest in sound and music, so I studied one year of Sound Design.',
  'After that I got accepted in ENERC, which is the National Cinema School. I learned a lot about the industry and Sound Design for Cinema, which was my specialization, but found out that I was not very interested in this kind of career.',
  'Around that time I started to learn to code. A friend introduced me to Frontend Development and I started an intense self-learning path diving deep into web technologies. I learned about the basics (HTML, CSS, JS) and then I started working on some real world projects, which taught me a lot in a short period of time.'
