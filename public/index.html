Mi name is Guido, and I'm a frontend developer from Barcelona, Spain.</p><p class="hidden">I've fallen in love with code around 2012, although I've always had a profound interest in the arts, technology and science. When I started my learning path, I decided that the field of frontend development was the one I should dive into, because of my deep interest in design and the visual arts, and because I became aware of the many uses and applications of these technologies and how they impact in people's lives.</p><p class="hidden">I consider myself to be a true team player. From the feedback I received in my previous jobs I feel like I can bring a lot to the table, both in terms of technical expertise and also in the area of soft skills. I was frequently told that I have great communication skills, and I'm very helpful and empathetic with others. I'm always willing to take the time and put the effort to bring the work we are delivering to the next level. Also, 'm very calm and approachable, which I believe are good qualities when working inside a team.</p><p class="hidden">I believe my background in arts and design is what makes me stand out. Not only can I deliver high quality code using the latest tools, but I can also engage in a meaningful discussion about the visual design of the system, UX strategies and interaction design of the project we are working on.</p><p class="hidden">On the more technical side, I consider myself right now to be mainly a React developer. I love the JS ecosystem and I'm always looking for new tools and libraries to bring more value to the work I do. Also I'm starting to learn tools related with 3D visualization and creative coding</p><p class="hidden">Hope we can work together and build something great!</p><a href="./bio.html">Read full bio</a></section><section class="contact"><h2>Contact</h2><div class="contact-links"><a href="mailto:guido.glarosa@gmail.com">‚úâÔ∏è guido.glarosa@gmail.com</a><a href="">üìû +54 11 6361-6161</a></div></section><section class="links"><h2>Links</h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guido-la-rosa/">LinkedIn</a><a href="https://github.com/guidolarosa">Github</a><a href="https://coyoteweb.studio/">Coyote Web Studio</a><a href="#">Instagram</a><a href="https://guidolarosa-blog.tumblr.com/">Illustrations</a></section><div id="change-theme">üåà Change Theme</div><div id="print">üñ® Get Printable Version</div></section><section class="double-column" id="work-history"><section class="section-title"><h2>Work History</h2></section><section class="body-wrapper"><section class="section-body"><section class="work-item"><h3>Coyote Web Studio</h3><h4>Frontend Developer ‚Ä¢ UI / UX Developer</h4><div class="period">2020 - Present</div><p>I created Coyote Web Studio once I started collaborating with other people on my freelance projects.

I learned a lot about the industry and Sound Design for Cinema, which was my specialization, but found out that I was not very interested in this kind of career.</p><p>Around that time I discovered code. A friend introduced me to Frontend Development and I started an intense self-learning path diving deep into web technologies. I learned about the basics (HTML, CSS, JS) and then I started working on some real world projects, which taught me a lot in a short period of time.</p><p>Meanwhile I learned a lot of stuff related to computer graphics, illustration, animation, design and design tools. I also worked briefly doing Motion Graphics and making illustrations (you can see them following my links).</p><p>Now, I consider myself a React developer. I've been working with react for the past 5 years and I love it. It makes creating interfaces a delight and the way it lets you compose reusable components makes it a great choice when working closely with designers.</p></section></section><section class="single-column" id="skills"><section class="section-title"><h2>Skills</h2></section><section class="section-body"><section class="technical-skills"><h3>Technical Skills</h3><div class="skill"><h4>React JS</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="80"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>NextJS</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="80"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>CSS</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="90"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>JavaScript</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="80"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>Git / Github</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="80"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>Wordpress</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="60"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>Figma</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="70"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div><div class="skill"><h4>Photoshop / Illustrator</h4><div class="skill-bar" value="60"><div class="skill-level"></div></div></div></section><section class="languages"><h3>Languages</h3><div class="language"><h4>Spanish / Castellano</h4><p>Native</p></div><div class="language"><h4>English</h4><p>Upper Intermediate (B2)</p><p>I can have a fluid conversation about technical topics.</p></div></section></section></section></section><script src="./main.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body>
